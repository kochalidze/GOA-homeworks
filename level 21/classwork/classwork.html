                <p>Football is a family of team sports that involve, 
                to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
                Unqualified, the word football generally means the form of football that is the most popular where the word is used. 
                 Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in Australia, Canada, South Africa, the United States,
                 and sometimes in Ireland and New Zealand); Australian rules football;
                 Gaelic football; gridiron football (specifically American football, 
                 arena football, or Canadian football); International rules fo rugby league football; and rugby union football.[1] These various forms of football share, to varying degrees, 
                common origins and are known as "football codes".</p>

                <p>There are a number of references to traditional, ancient, or prehistoric ball games played in many different parts of the world.[2][3][4] 
                    Contemporary codes of football can be traced back to the codification of these games at English public schools during the 19th century, 
                    itself an outgrowth of medieval football.[5][6] The expansion and cultural power of the British Empire allowed these rules of football to spread to areas 
                    of British influence outside the directly controlled Empire.[7] By the end of the 19th century, distinct regional codes were already developing:
                     Gaelic football, for example, deliberately incorporated the rules of local traditional football games in order to maintain their heritage.[8] In 1888,
                      the Football League was founded in England, becoming the first of many professional football associations. 
                    During the 20th century, several of the various kinds of football grew to become some of the most popular team sports in the world.[9]</p>

                <h2>Common elements</h2>
                <p>The various codes of football share certain common elements and can be 
                    grouped into two main classes of football: carrying codes like American 
                    football, Canadian football, Australian football,
                     rugby union and rugby league, where the ball is moved about the field
                      while being held in the hands or thrown, and kicking codes such as 
                      association football and Gaelic football, where the ball is moved
                       primarily with the feet,
                     and where handling is strictly limited.[10]</p>
                <p>Common rules among the sports include:[11</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>Two teams usually have between 11 and 18 players; 
                        some variations that have fewer players
                         (five or more per team) are also popular.[12]</li>
                    <li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
                    <li>Goals or points resulting from players putting the ball between two goalposts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In all codes, common skills include passing, tackling, 
                    evasion of tackles, catching and kicking.[10] In most codes, 
                    there are rules restricting the movement of players offside, 
                    and players scoring a goal must put the
                     ball either under or over a crossbar between the goalposts.</p>

                <h2>Etymology</h2>
                <p>There are conflicting explanations of the origin of the word "football".
                     It is widely assumed that the word "football" 
                     (or the phrase "foot ball") refers to the action of the
                      foot kicking a ball.[13] There is an alternative explanation, 
                      which is that football originally referred to a variety of games in
                       medieval Europe that were played on foot.[14]
                     There is no conclusive evidence for either explanation.</p>

                <h3>Ancient games</h3>
                <p>See also: Episkyros and Cuju</p>
                <p>The Chinese competitive game cuju is an early type of ball
                     game where feet were used, in some aspects resembling modern 
                     association football. It was possibly played around the Han dynasty 
                     and early Qin dynasty, based on an attestation in a military manual
                      from around the second to third centuries BC.[15][16][17] In one
                       verion, gameplay consisted of players passing the ball between 
                     without it falling, before kicking the ball through a circular hole  placed in the middle of the pitch. Unlike association football, the
                        two teams did not interact with each other but instead stayed on opposite sides of the pitch.[18] The Japanese version of cuju is 
                        kemari (蹴鞠), and was developed during the Asuka period.[19] This is known to have been played within the Japanese imperial 
                        court in Kyoto from about 600 AD. In kemari, several people stand 
                        in a circle and kick a ball to each other,
                     trying not to let the ball drop to the ground.</p>

                     <h3>Ancient Greece and Rome</h3>
                     <p>The Ancient Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games,
                         some of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is 
                         believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as "ἐπίσκυρος" 
                         (Episkyros)[20][21] or "φαινίνδα" (phaininda),[22] which is mentioned by a 
                         Greek playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the 
                         Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c. 150 – c. 215 AD). These 
                         games appear to have resembled rugby football.[23][24][25][26][27] The 
                         Roman politician Cicero (106–43 BC) describes the case of a man who was
                          killed whilst having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop.
                           Roman ball games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis.[28][29]
                            Episkyros is described as an 
                        early form of football by FIFA.[30]</p>
